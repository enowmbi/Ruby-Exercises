using jobless to generate your cv
=================================
Jobless is a simple DSL written in Ruby for generating CVs. It generates HTML files, which can be easily converted to PDF format if needed. Here's an example of Jobless code.

DSL syntax
------------
Jobless.cv do
  name "John Doe"
  email "john.doe@gmail.com"

  employment do
    entry do
      title "Full-stack Rails developer"
      company "Royal Programming Squad"
      start_date "April 2015"
      end_date "June 2015"
    end
    entry do
      title "C# Developer"
      company "Microsoft"
      start_date "January 2015"
      end_date "April 2015"
    end
  end
end

Installation
------------
You can install jobless via RubyGems

gem install jobless
Then just create a new ruby file, require jobless and start coding. When you run that file your CV will be generated.

How to start?
--------------
The best way to start is by forking the example repository. It's convinient because you can use your GitHub repo to store the CV. #cv is stored in the application directory # could this be changed - make it flexible

Available keywords
------------------
Personal info
Following keywords are available on top level:
-----------------------------------------------
name
email
location
address
homepage

Groups and entries
------------------
Key part of a CV are lists of you archievements grouped in different categories. You can add groups to your CV with group keyword. Each group consists of multiple entries

group "Group title" do
  entry do
  end
end
For convenience, Jobless provides several keywords with pre-defined titles.

employment
education
open_source
other_experience
education do
  entry do
    title "Ruby on Rails Course"
  end
end
Entry
-----
Entry describes one instance of your experience. For example one job position or open source project. Following keywords are available for each entry.

title
company
homepage
technologies
description
start_date
end_date

They can also have multiple bulletin keywords, each of which will be rendered as one bulletin item.

GitHub Repo
-----------
GitHub Repo is a special type of entry that given a repository name will fetch and automatically fill in title, homepage and description via GitHub API.

open_source do
  github_repo 'dabrorius/jobless'
end
You can also override existing or add new keywords to that entry.

open_source do
  github_repo 'dabrorius/jobless' do
    description 'A different descrpition'
    technologies 'Ruby'
  end
end

Style
------
If you don't like the default style, you can provide your custom stylesheet to be used in the CV.

Jobless.cv do
  name "John Doe"
  email "john.doe@gmail.com"
  stylesheet "my_awesome_style.css"
end

#TODO - future features
========================
write specs/tests & generate factories/fixtures
allow for an infinite number of groups,entries and personal info - using method missing instead of define_method
allow users to specify directory for storing files may be sending by email
users should be able to login
users should be able to make entries from browser by integrating gem with Rails app.
users should be able to persist entries to a database through Rails or without Rails - checks if it's in Rails 
cv should be analyzed and stats given on great points  
recalculate size so that you can display content without compressing entry
use at the bottom page 1 of 2 and so on.
